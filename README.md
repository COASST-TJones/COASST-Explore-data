# COASST-Explore-data
This repo contains the files for a local version of the R shiny Data viz app for visualizing COASST beached bird data.

Please note: the data folder is private, as the data shown on these apps is from the COASST program and requires a data use agreement for public use. However, the code files are publicly available. 

Furthermore, the apps running online based on the most current data can be viewed at
